# Beyond Training Data: How Elemental Features Enhance ML-Based Formation Energy Predictions  

ðŸš€ **Coming Soon!** ðŸš€  

This repository will contain the code and implementation for our paper:  
**"Beyond Training Data: How Elemental Features Enhance ML-Based Formation Energy Predictions"**  

## ðŸ”¬ Overview  
Machine learning (ML)-based interatomic potentials have shown great promise in accelerating materials simulations. However, their ability to generalize to **out-of-distribution (OoD)** compositions, particularly those containing unseen elements, remains a challenge. This work explores how leveraging **elemental features** can enhance the **generalization** of ML models for **formation energy predictions**.

We demonstrate that incorporating **elemental descriptors** instead of learned embeddings significantly improves extrapolation to materials containing unseen elements. Our experiments, conducted with **SchNet** and **MACE**, show that using **element property-based embeddings** yields superior performance in cases where standard approaches fail.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Implementation of **SchNet** and **MACE** with elemental feature embeddings.  
- Generalization experiments on out-of-distribution materials.  
- Comparison of learned embeddings vs. element-based embeddings.  
- Analysis of how **element features influence model predictions** in ML-based potentials.  

## ðŸ“‚ Coming Soon  
The code is currently being **cleaned and optimized** for public release. Stay tuned for:  
âœ… Preprocessed datasets and scripts for **Matbench v0.1** formation energy predictions.  
âœ… Training & evaluation scripts for **OoD generalization tests**.  
âœ… Reproducible Jupyter notebooks with experiment visualizations.  
âœ… Model checkpoints for quick testing.  



This should work well as a placeholder while you finalize the code! Let me know if you want to tweak anything. ðŸš€
